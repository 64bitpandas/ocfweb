    # In Django, if you have an app like "announcements" and another app like
    # "docs", it's not okay for both to provide templates with the same name
    # (e.g. "index.html") since they all get thrown onto the same templates
    # path. One of the applications' index.html will arbitrarily always be
    # shown on both of the applications.
    #
    # To avoid this undesired behavior, the hook below forces you to prefix the
    # templates with some directory first. In practice, your templates should
    # all be at ocfweb/$app/templates/$app/.
    #
    # This kinda sucks, but that's the world we live in.
