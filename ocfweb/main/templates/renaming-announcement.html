            <h3>Board announces new name for the OCF</h3>
            <hr />
            <p>
                BERKELEY (CA) â€” Late Thursday night, the Board of Directors of the Open Computing
                Facility voted to rename the organization to the Open Facility
                for Computing (OFC).
            </p>
            <p>
                "After seeing 'OCF' written as 'OFC' by people on Facebook,
                Twitter, and even by the Daily Cal's writers all in the same
                day, I decided it was worth bringing up at one of our
                meetings," said Chris Kuehl, the organization's former Site
                Manager. (Chris recently stepped down to focus on his studies.)
            </p>
            <p>
                After a heated discussion (and short break to get boba), the
                members of the Board voted unanimously to adopt the new name
                and acronym.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I try really hard to stay away from social media like Reddit
                and Facebook," said Nick Impicciche, the OFC's current General
                Manager. "Still, we're pretty strong believers in democracy,
                and it's clear what the people wanted."
            </p>
            <p>
                After the decision was announced, <strike>OCF</strike> OFC
                technicians worked into the night to get the website moved from
                <tt>ocf.berkeley.edu</tt> to its new home at
                <tt>ofc.berkeley.edu</tt>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the coming days, we'll be reaching out to student groups
                using our web hosting to ask them to replace their now-outdated
                "Hosted by OCF" web banners. We're also working with facilities
                to get some stickers printed to cover up the signs in the
                hallways of MLK.
            </p>

                The Open Facility for Computing is an all-volunteer, student-run
                organization. It was founded in 1989 to serve the interests of
                the UC Berkeley campus community.

            <h3>About our organization</h3>
            <p>
                Founded back in 1989 by an agile team of Node.js developers
                disillusioned by a lack of free campus printing, the OFC
                (formerly OCF) has established itself as an important stop
                along the day of any busy undergrad.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our staff work hard to provide valuable services to the
                campus community:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="{% url 'doc' 'services/lab/printing' %}">Free
                        printing</a>, used by over 5,000 students per semester
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="{% url 'doc' 'services/lab' %}">
                        A spiffy computer lab in 171 MLK</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="{% url 'doc' 'services/lab/printing' %}">Free
                        printing</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="{% url 'doc' 'services/web' %}">Web, application,
                        and email hosting</a>
                    for over 80% of student groups and thousands of individual
                    students
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="{% url 'doc' 'services/lab/printing' %}">Free
                        printing</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                With the change in name, our volunteer staffers hope to spend
                less time correcting usage of our acronym, and more time trying
                to figure out why your paper didn't come out of the printer.
