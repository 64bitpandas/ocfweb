                We are looking to hire students to be OCF Operations
                staff for the 2019 academic year and onward! This includes two paid
                positions, Operations Assistant and Operations Manager, neither
                of which require any technical experience. These are very
                important roles, and without dedicated and passionate students
                to fill them, the OCF will not be able to stay open next
                semester.
            </i></p>

            <h3>Operations Assistants</h3>
            <p>
                Operations Assistants will have the following responsibilities:

                <ul>
                    <li>Staffing the front desk</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Maintaining lab security</li>
                        <li>Providing help to OCF members using the lab</li>
                        <li>Carrying out regular lab maintenance</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Working on projects that benefit the OCF</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Marketing and outreach</li>
                        <li>Collecting feedback on OCF services</li>
                        <li>Organizing events taking place in the lab</li>
                        <li>Researching and applying for additional sources of
                            funding for the OCF</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Attending regular meetings with the Operations Manager
                        and the other Operations Assistants</li>
                </ul>

                This job position will be paid $13.75 per hour.
            </p>

            <h3>Operations Manager</h3>
            <p>
                The Operations Manager will have the same responsibilities as
                the Operations Assistants (see above), except they will spend
                less time staffing the front desk of the OCF, and instead will
                spend the remaining time performing more managerial duties,
                such as leading meetings with the Operations Assistants,
                delegating projects, and scheduling shifts for the OCF front
                desk. This job will involve more responsibilities and use of
                communication skills than the Operations Assistant role, but it
                is also paid more, at $15.75 per hour.
            </p>

            <h3>About the OCF</h3>
            <p>
                The OCF provides free computing services for any students,
                faculty, or staff that lack access to the resources they need.
                Since its founding in 1989, the services offered by the OCF
                have grown massively, especially in the past couple years as
                the OCF moved to a much nicer new lab location in 171 MLK
                Student Union.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of the variety of services we provide to the campus
                community include:
            </p>
