            One of the benefits of hosting your student group's site with the OCF is that you have the option of using an address like "mygroup.berkeley.edu" to access your site.
        However, in order to obtain a berkeley.edu name for your site, you must meet both university policies regarding acceptable use of berkeley.edu names, as well as OCF policies for virtual hosting.

            Please start by reading the

            If you believe your group satisfies all requirements listed, you
            may complete the form below to request for us to set up a virtual
            host for your account.

                    with OCF policies, we will submit a name request to the
                    university on your behalf using the information you provided.
