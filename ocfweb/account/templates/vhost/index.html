            One of the benefits of hosting your student group's site with the OCF is that you have the option of using an address like "mygroup.berkeley.edu" to access your site.
        However, in order to obtain a berkeley.edu name for your site, you must meet both university policies regarding acceptable use of berkeley.edu names, as well as OCF policies for virtual hosting.
        </p>
        <p>Please start by reading the <a href="http://wiki.ocf.berkeley.edu/services/vhost/">OCF Virtual Hosting documentation</a>. If you believe your group satisfies all requirements listed, you may complete the form below to request for us to set up a virtual host for your account.</p>

            You are currently logged in using the OCF account

            request a virtual hosting for, please <a href="{% url 'logout' %}">
            log out</a> and log back in.

                    All virtual hosting requests are subject to both university and
                    OCF approval. Once we have verified that you are in compliance
                    with OCF policies, we will submit a name request to the
                    university on your behalf using the information you provided.
