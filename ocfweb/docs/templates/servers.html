      <p>At the OCF, there are three physical servers whose job is to host virtual servers. These physical servers are hypervisors running QEMU and KVM. The servers which people see on a daily basis, like the login server, the web server, the print server, and things like that are all virtual machines hosted on these hypervisors.</p>
      <p>Below is a list of servers and other hosts at the OCF. VMs are grouped under the hypervisor hosting them.</p>
